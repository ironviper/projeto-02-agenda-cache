# Local storage contact book
The contacts you've added to the contact book will be saved in your browser local storage.
So you can save your contacts, close the browser, open it later and all your contacts will still be there.
## Features
- Flip pages by clicking in the left and right arrows.
- Go to a specific page by filling the page number in the page number display below the contact book.
- Add a contact by filling the form above the contact book.
- Delete a contact by click the "trash can icon" next to the contact phone.
- Add a page to the end of the contact book by clicking the "+" button below it. If you try to add a new contact and there is no space left in the contact book, a new page will be automatically added.
- Remove the last page of the contact book by clicking the "X" button below it.
